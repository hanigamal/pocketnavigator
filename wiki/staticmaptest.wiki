== How To Export an XML Using Desktop Version ==
  # Run desktop version and enter the directions
  # Click button step1 (hold for few seconds, page will load)
  # Click button step2 (hold for few seconds, page will load)
  # Click Export button to export an XML file.
  # Once the direction-info is extracted, you can export this in an xml file by clicking "export direction info button"

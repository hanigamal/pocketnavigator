This is pair of (sample) application, which can be used to borrow ideas to write your own maps application. Basically this solution has 2 parts :

### Desktop Application ###
  * Uses Maps AJAX API to get data in c#.net
  * Exports Data in to XML
  * Plan is to port on Bing Maps + other map technologies (currently using Google maps api)
  * See **[staticmaptest](staticmaptest.md)** project in the solution

### Mobile App (windows mobile 6) ###
  * Loads Exported Direction Info Data to shows turn by turn Navigation.
  * Mobile app never uses any maps api
  * See PocketDashboard project in the solution


### What You need to compile this code ###
  * Visual studio 2005 or higher
  * Windows Mobile 6 SDK
